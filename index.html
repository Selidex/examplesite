  <h2>School</h2>

    <div class="tb">
      <p id="school">School has always been one of my refuges. It is one of the places where I felt seen. I went to Holliday ISD, in Holliday, Texas. I was in the marching band, going to State all 3 years that the competition was held. I was also a member of the One Act Play as the soundboard technician, proceeding to Regionals for two years. I also was a member of the Speech and Debate team, going to State for Lincoln Doulgass debate my senior year. I graduated 4th of the class of 2012. Afterwards, I attended Midwestern State University for 4 years, Majoring first in Psychology, and then in Computer Science with a Psychology minor. Unfortunately, I had to take a leave of absence due to health issues. After my recovery, I continued my education at Holberton Tulsa, where I spent two years studying full stack development with a specialization in AR/VR development.</p>

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <p>As of the time of this writing, this is my first full year of teaching professionally. I have taken on several student teaching roles, both as study leader in high school, as well as tutoring while in college. I also was the Web Development instructor for one of Urban Coders Guild's summer camps in 2023. Teaching has been a passion of mine since I was a little kid, and it is a dream come true to be teaching web development to young minds today.</p>

  <h2>Gaming</h2>
  <p>Playing video games is one of my earliest memories. I owned my first gaming system as a young kid, maybe six or seven years. It was the original Playstation. The first video games I remember playing include:
  <ul>
    <li>Digmon World</li>
    <li>Legend of Dragoon</li>
    <li>Chrono Trigger</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy VIII</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy IX</li>
  </ul>
  Since that time in my life, I have owned several gaming systems including most of the gameboys and nintendo ds, every playstation generation, the nintendo 64, and a gaming PC. I still use video games as my primary pass time, both as a hobby and as an inspiration for my other works.</p>
  <h3>Streaming</h3>
  My passion for gaming has lead me to start streaming my games on Twitch. I can be found <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/selidex">here</a> streaming various games, or occasionally leading impromptu leasons on how to make video games using Unity, or how to design and program a website. Included below is what is called in the web development world an iframe, that leads directly to my streaming site.</p>

  <h2>Writing</h2>
<p>My third passion in life, aside from gaming and teaching, is creating stories. While this usually takes the form of writing books and short stories, it also comes through in both my game design as well as my D&D stories that I create for the players that I run games for. I am also published in two separate poetry books from my days in school.
